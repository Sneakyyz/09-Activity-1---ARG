// Instructions:
// 1. Find the statement that causes the compilation error.
// 2. Determine the output if that statement is removed.

// Question 1
class A {
    public void test() { 
        System.out.print("A");
    }
}
class B extends A { 
    public void test() { 
        System.out.print("B");
    }
}

// Answer: There were no ERROR in Question 1 because it defines both class A and B properly.
// Expected Output if the error line is removed: No Output
// Explanation: There is no expected output because there is no main method.

// Question 2
public class C extends A {
    public void test() {
        System.out.print("C");
    }
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        A b1 = new A();
        A b2 = new C();
        b1 = (A)b2;
        A b3 = (B)b2; // This is the error
        b1.test();
        b2.test();
    }
}

// Answer: The ERROR is "A b3 = (B)b2;" because b2 is an instance of C, not B.
// Expected Output if the error line is removed: CC
